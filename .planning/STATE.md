## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Projects as separate entity from channels (tasks need container that can link to multiple channels)
- Kanban-only for v1 (reduce scope, validate core task model before adding views)
- Project creates auto-channel (every project needs discussion space by default)
- Project membership controls channel (simpler mental model - project is primary, channel inherits)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
