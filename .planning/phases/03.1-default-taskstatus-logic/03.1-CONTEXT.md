# Phase 03.1: default taskStatus logic - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Implement default task status logic for projects — seed statuses at project creation, auto-assign the default status to new tasks, and sync status changes with the denormalized `completed` field. This phase does NOT add custom/user-defined statuses or status reordering.

## Implementation Decisions

### Default statuses
- 3-column workflow: **Todo**, **In Progress**, **Done**
- Todo is marked as `default=true` (the status assigned to new tasks)
- Statuses are seeded at project creation time (inline in the create project mutation)

### Auto-assignment
- Every new task automatically gets the default status (Todo)
- No tasks should exist without a status

### Completed field sync
- Setting status to Done → `completed=true` (auto-sync)
- Moving a task OUT of Done does NOT auto-reset `completed` — requires explicit uncomplete action
- One-way automatic sync only

### Claude's Discretion
- Schema design for taskStatuses table (fields, indexes)
- How to wire status seeding into existing project creation mutation
- How kanban board columns map to these statuses
- UI updates needed in task creation and status display
